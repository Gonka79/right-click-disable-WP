Step 1: Access Your WordPress Theme
Log in to your WordPress admin panel.
Go to Appearance > Theme Editor.

Step 2: Edit the Header File
In the theme files list, find and select the header.php file.
Add the following JavaScript code just before the </head> tag:
html
Copiar c√≥digo
<script type="text/javascript">
document.addEventListener('contextmenu', function(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
});
</script>


Step 3: Save the Changes
Click the "Update File" button to save the changes.
Code Explained
The JavaScript code adds an event listener to the document that listens for the contextmenu event (which triggers on right-click) and calls e.preventDefault(), which prevents the browser's default action (showing the context menu).

Considerations
Theme Compatibility: Ensure your theme doesn't update automatically, as an update might overwrite your changes.
Child Theme Files: If you're using a child theme, make these changes in the child theme's header.php file instead of the main theme.
